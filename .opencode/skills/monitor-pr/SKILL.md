name: monitor-pr
description: Monitor GitHub PRs with the pr_monitor tool and handle incoming "[PR Monitor]" reports. Use immediately after raising a PR, when the user asks to monitor/watch a PR, and whenever a "[PR Monitor]" message arrives in the session (CI results, new review comments, merge conflicts, approvals). Requires gh.

# monitor-pr

Watch a GitHub PR in the background via the `pr_monitor` tool and act on the
factual reports it delivers to this session.

## Starting a monitor

**Proactively start a monitor right after raising a PR** (e.g. after `gh pr create`):

```
pr_monitor(action: "start", pr: "owner/repo#123")
```

- The `pr` argument is always explicit — `owner/repo#123` or a full PR URL. Never a bare number.
- One monitor per PR; start several monitors for several PRs.
- Monitors belong to this session and **do not survive an opencode restart**. When
  resuming PR work in a fresh opencode instance, check `pr_monitor(action: "status")`
  and re-start monitors as needed.
- Tuning (debounce, poll interval, CI wait, ignored comment tag) lives in
  `.opencode/pr-monitor.json` — not in tool arguments.

## Handling a `[PR Monitor]` report

Reports state facts only (CI status, mergeability, reviews, comment counts). Decide and
act as follows, addressing everything in the report in one batch:

| Report says | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| `CI: failing (…)` | Inspect the failures (`gh pr checks <pr> --repo owner/repo`, `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed --repo owner/repo`), fix the root cause, commit and push. Never delete or weaken tests to go green. |
| `Mergeable: CONFLICTING` | Merge the latest base branch INTO the PR branch. First resolve the PR's actual base ref: `gh pr view <number> --repo owner/repo --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`, then `git fetch origin && git merge origin/<baseRefName>`. **NEVER rebase.** Resolve conflicts conservatively so functionality from both sides is preserved — when unsure, read the full context of both changes before choosing. Run the relevant tests, then push the merge commit. |
| New inline comments / `changes_requested` | Follow the `address-pr-comments` skill: fetch unresolved threads, assess validity, implement fixes, reply to every thread. |
| New issue comments | Read them (`gh pr view <number> --repo owner/repo --comments`) and act only if they request something. |
| Approved + CI passing + 0 unresolved threads | Nothing to fix — summarize the PR state to the user. |
| `— MERGED` / `— CLOSED` | The monitor already stopped itself. Nothing to do. |

> **Owner-account comments are NOT your own replies.** The agent pushes commits
> and posts review replies using the **same GitHub account as the human owner**,
> so a report that lists new comments from that account (e.g. "1 new: 1
> &lt;owner&gt;") may be the **human giving you an instruction**, not an echo of
> your own reply. Agent replies always start with `[Sesori reply]` (see the
> `address-pr-comments` skill). Treat any owner-account comment **without** that
> prefix as a human instruction — fetch it and act on it (including when it
> overrides a decision you already made). Never skip a reported owner-account
> comment by assuming you wrote it.

## After handling a report — no manual flush needed

A delivered `[PR Monitor]` report has **already advanced** the "new since last flush"
baseline, so the activity it reported is not echoed back at you. The report itself acts as
the flush. Just handle everything in the report in one batch, then wait for the next report
(or for merge/close). Do **not** flush as a routine step after handling a report.

## Other actions

- `pr_monitor(action: "status")` — list this session's monitors (also useful before ending a work session).
- `pr_monitor(action: "flush", pr: "owner/repo#123")` or `pr_monitor(action: "flush", pr: "all")` — force an immediate full status report on demand (this also advances the baseline). Use it only when you want the current state right now instead of waiting for the next scheduled report — never as a routine step after handling a report.
- `pr_monitor(action: "stop", pr: "owner/repo#123")` or `pr_monitor(action: "stop", pr: "all")` — stop watching without waiting for merge.
